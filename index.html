# Definitions: FND

- .blue[Functional Neurological Symptoms Disorder] was added as an inclusion term to Conversion Disorder in the DSM-5, which was published in May of 2013.
- A patient can be diagnosed with FND if they have motor and/or sensory findings providing:
  - “evidence of incompatibility between the symptom and recognized neurological or medical conditions” (American Psychiatric Association, 2013, Stone et al., 2010b).
- The symptom must impair social and/or occupational functioning or lead individuals to seek a medical opinion. There are no duration or severity criteria or explicit rules for exclusion based on additional symptoms.

- .blue[Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder] the most recent term used in the ICD-11 (World Health Organization International Coding manual) despite pushback from FND Hope and leading FND specialists around the world.

???
The term functional has been used to describe symptoms which impacts upon neurological function but which do not have the same underlying pathological abnormality.

]]

???
These visualisations come from a recent survey of people living with FND.

This is the largest survey of this kind. As you can see on the right hand side from the symptom cooccurrence network there is a high comorbidity of various forms of symptoms with FND.

Quite concerning are the rates of co-occurance with other symptoms which are not core FND symptoms, for example 93% of people with FND also experience fatigue.

From the visual analog clock on the left you can see the responses to a range of questions from people living with FND. Quite interesting is the response to the question "Cause a combination of physical/stress", is very high. This is a little insight as to what people with FND believe the cause of it to be, and based on this it is both physical and stress related.

FND takes many shapes and forms. The symptoms that one person experiences for FND may look very different to another persons experiences. This is what we call heterogeneity.As the constellation of symptoms that individuals experience can be so different, it is inherently difficult to classify subtypes. What we can do however is group the types of symptoms that people tend to experience. This grid is based on the euro symptoms website which is a fantastic resource. For each of these categories of symptoms there is a attached information sheet for patients and professionals to download.

Working in and then EAD service, the people that I see all experience some form of functional seizure. Despite this, the vast majority of patients will also experience another form of functional symptom.

# Definitions: Non-epileptic seizures

- One manifestation or constellation of FND.
- In DSM-5, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are classified as a form of conversion disorder, or functional neurological symptom disorder, with the term "functional" referring to an impairment of normal bodily functioning.
- Disruption of usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, id, or perception (amnesia, fugue, dissociative id disorder, depersonalisation disorder) (Goldstein et al, 2000)

# Inter and Intra-variability

- Different people experience different symptoms (as illustrated in the co-occurance network in a previous slide).
- Symptoms of non-epileptic attacks are not always the same.
- Symptoms change over time
  - For example, some patients with functional seizures may initially experience  panic attacks, but over time, symptoms of anxiety may diminish and manifesta- tions of dissociation increase (Goldstein and Mellers, 2006).

.Large[.red[Gregg do you have any further info/papers?]]

???
As mentioned before the symptoms of non-epileptic attacks or other forms of functional disorder can look very different from one person to the next.In addition, the nature of symptoms can change dramatically for each person over time.For example so I may start off with one dominant form of symptom, but overtime over symptoms become more or less apparent. One person that I am working with currently, when he will affect the service his dominant symptom was functional seizures. But by the time his appointment came round he had developed a functional speech disorder. This caused him to hijacking in his neck and increased effort to speak.

# How common is NEAD?

**Approximately:**

- 20,000 people in the UK have this diagnosis – but there are likely to be many more.
- 1 out of every 5 people referred to a first seizure clinic go on to have a diagnosis of NEAD.
- NEAD accounts for up to 50% of patients brought to hospital with suspected ‘status epilepticus’. Still likely to be an under estimate.

(Howell, Owen, Chadwick, 1989; Kotsoupoulos et al., 2003, Rawlings, Brown &amp; Reuber, 2017)

A recent estimate of prevalence from Norway found prevalence to be 23.8 per 100,000&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/epi.16949"&gt; (Villagrán 2021) &lt;/a&gt;

**Note:** It is hard to accurately quantify prevalence rates in non-epileptic attacks due to common diagnostic delay and patients being lost to follow-up.

???
- Because of the complexities around diagnosis, this 20,000 person estimate is likely to be a underestimation.

# Who is most likely to be affected?

1. **Age:**
Young people (15–19) may actually be more at risk and the point when onset is most likely. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/epi.16949"&gt;Villagrán (2021) &lt;/a&gt; - 59.5 per 100,000.
1. **Gender** Gender disparities are far less evident in younger and older cohorts (e.g.,
&lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2021/08/16/jnnp-2021-326443.abstract"&gt;Jungilligens (2021) &lt;/a&gt;
1. **Epilepsy:**
High rate of comorbidity.
1. **Psychiatric comorbdity**
  1. Anxiety and depression = 
  1. "Personality disorder" =
  1. PTSD
  1. Trauma

.Large[.red[Gregg you got any good references/statistics?]]

???
- Age: Generally consistent with Hansen 2020 pediatric paper which found that across pediatric populations incidence rates is highest in 16-17 years old. 
- Gender: Greater female preponderance in adolescence and adults however this seems to become less evident in older people.
- Trauma: Lots of people who have not experienced trauma.

# Diagnosis

.pull-left[
### How is it diagnosed?
Diagnosis usually by a Neurologist or Neuropsychiatrist based on:

- Clinical history
- Videos
- Objective signs
- Subjective experience
- EEG (electroencephalogram) 
- ECG (electrocardiogram)
- Videotelemetry
]

.pull-right[Journey to diagnosis can be
.red[very long].
Recent estimate of 3.2 years (although 48% in same year).

![](files/img/pnes-types.png)

]

???
One of the key dilemmas facing this field is the obstacles to prompt and accurate diagnosis. Many professionals are simply unfamiliar with this condition, or maybe somewhat familiar but I'm confident to make accurate diagnosis.
What's more it is, or can be very difficult to distinguish between epilepsy and functional seizures, and therefore it may need the specialist investigation of a highly specialist neurologist.
May include the patient having to come to hospital for an inpatient admission so that they can be observed having seizures during the process known as video toiletry.
Because of these dilemmas in reaching a diagnosis it is unfortunately common for patients to go a number of years before receiving a diagnosis.

# Misdiagnosis &amp; delayed diagnosis

Because NEAD can have clinical comparisons to epilepsy it can be difficult to distinguish one from the other.

This can lead to a variety of concerns around:
- Diagnostic delay.
- Response to status epilepticus.
- Prolonged use of anti-convulsants.
- Lack of access to neccersary support.

New paper demonstrating rates of people diagnosed and treated for status epilepticus who infact had non-epileptic attack &lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/early/2021/08/16/jnnp-2021-326443.full.pdf"&gt;(Jungilligens et al., 2021) &lt;/a&gt;

???
Among 1210 patients diagnosed and treated as status epilepticus, 980 were aged eight years or older. Of these patients, 79 (8.1%) were discharged with a final diagnosis of pPNES. Of these, 55 (70%) were female and the mean age was 32.6 years (SD: 15.9 years), ranging from eight to 84 years.

I think that many people who experience functional symptoms would feel the slide is really important. The language that gets used in referring to these experiences can be highly variable. As you can see on the slide there are a range of different terms which have all been used to describe a very similar experience or set of symptoms.
The problem is some of The terms you can see are far less favoured by the FND community, and rightly so. There are unfortunately a lot of unhelpful views, stigmatisation held towards people that have this condition. And therefore some of these terms may. Hold onto those pejorative views.
There is unfortunately no consensus as to which term is the best, almost accurate.

And this is a topic of high debate currently. Terms which are generally less helpful are pseudoseizures, psychological seizures and conversion disorder.

The bar chart that you can see shows the preference ratings of the commonly used terms in order to show rank. The terms are the score so a low preference rating is desirable and high preference rating is undesirable. As you can see hysteria pseudoseizures, Somatoform disorder are all less preferred.

One of the few things which I really hope that people take away from this teaching is that the symptoms and experience of functional symptoms are not under the conscious control of volition of the person experiencing them.
This is really important because there is a history of people with FND not being believed or been described as "faking".
These two conditions are different from FND And do you have some level of conscious control. While I am sure that there are a number of people with functional symptoms which may in fact be lingering, I truly believe that this is a very very very small minority.

Psychological experiences influence the body .red[.Large[**All The Time**]]

- Sudden shock = heart beats faster
- Embarrassment = face goes red
- Upset = eyes produce tears

It is normal for changes to happen in the body
**without** a medical cause or disease
(e.g. tears when we feel sad are not caused by a disease; it is the mind-body link).
#### NEAD also happens through this Mind-Body link.

What we know about the mind and body are that they are, as I'm sure you already know, intrinsically related. How we think and feel can have a huge influence on our body and our visceral experience. On our very relatable set of examples, I'm sure people have had experience of shedding a tear and feeling really sad or heart rate increasing and feeling quite scared or shocked.
This relationship between the mind and body is in a small part A small illustration of what can happen in NEAD. In thinking about any ID and also in treating it we are constantly thinking about this mind body link.

# Influence of trauma

-  A traumatic event = an incident that causes physical, emotional or psychological harm.
-  Can be single event or many unpleasant/threatening incidents
-  Could be recent or a long time ago

**FACT:** It is common for people with NEAD to have experienced some form of trauma

**BUT**: Many people with NEAD have NOT experienced a trauma

Although many people with NEAD can identify things that have happened/ are happening in their lives that contribute to a build-up of stress, many people do not.

The reasons why an individual develops NEAD is not always obvious at first, because everyone’s lives are different.

???
Trauma is something that gets brought up a lot when discussing functional seizures. Trauma or a traumatic event is an event or incident which includes some form of harm either physical emotional or psychological. This might be a single isolated incident (example car crash). Or it might be a more cumulative effect of lots of little things that happen over time (Example bullying).
Lots of people with functional symptoms have experienced some form of trauma, however there are also a subset of patients who have not.
When there is no trauma present, it can leave conditions feeling a little confused as to why the functional symptoms have developed. For some people, there may have been some form of trauma but which can no longer be remembered or is not recognised as being traumatic. For example so I might have had a close family bereavement, and the individual with functional symptoms may feel that this was unrelated to the functional symptoms, however it might be that overtime this is related.

# Role of Trauma

.small[Taken from &lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/90/7/813"&gt;Keynejad, 2021&lt;/a&gt;]]

???

This is a framework of the different ways that people can experience trauma, and how that can have an impact upon whether or not a person develops functional symptoms.
Each of these four quadrants show different permutations of how functional seizures might develop.
In the top left quadrant you have a scenari whereby you might have a biological risk to developing this condition and then they were exposed to a moderate stressful event in childhood and then later in adult there was a moderate precipitating factor.

# What can cause a person to go into/ stay in the amber zone?

1. Physical stress in the body (e.g., injury, illness, pain).
2. Difficult past experiences (e.g., situations that have felt threatening, loss of a loved one).
3. Current stressful situations (e.g., relating to finances, relationships, difficulty meeting responsibilities, loss of independence).
4. Emotional stress (e.g., worries about the future, difficult memories).

For many people, it is not one big thing that has caused them to go into and stay in the amber zone. It is often a combination of factors.

# Triggers

.small[
A study(N = 100 patients) has shown considerable heterogeneity of triggers (Reuber et al., 2011).
- Small minority (10%) stated that they were “always” aware of triggers
- 57% were aware of triggers for some but not all
- 31% claimed never to be aware of triggers
- 43% of patients stated that their PNES “always” “come on out of the blue without warning,”;
- Witnesses questioned in the same study reported being aware of seizure triggers more often than patients them- selves (Reuber et al., 2011)
- Most commonly perceived triggers were:
  - Emotional states (50%: feeling stressed, upset, anxious, aroused, neglected, nonspecific unwell)
  - Bodily states (21%: illness, loss of sleep, feeling hot or cold, tiredness, pain, feeling dehydrated or exhausted after something energetic)
  - External stimuli (9%: crowded places, flashing lights, black and white patterns, blue light, flashing lights, smoke / flames / dogs / household objects acting as traumatic reminders, sun on surface, neon lights)]

# Warnings

The frequency with which prodromal or warning symptoms been self-reported in patient cohorts varies widely, between 24% and 92% (for review see Reuber &amp; Rawlings)

People are at times more aware of the physical warning signs as opposed to the emotional warning signs.

# Experiences during the seizure

- Tends to last longer than in epilepsy.
- One study found that generalized tonic-clonic seizures lasted 50–92 seconds, whereas PNES lasted 20–805 seconds; Many PNES went on for more than 2 minutes (Gates et al., 1985).
- PNES continuing for over 30 minutes (also called pseudostatus or PNES status) occur in about one-third of patientsm
- More than one-quarter of patients diagnosed with PNES at epilepsy centers have received intensive care treatment for presumed status epilepticus at least once (Reuber et al., 2003).

# Common concerns about NEAD

The changes that are experienced before, during and after episodes are caused by the fight/ flight/ freeze response

These changes might look and feel uncomfortable/ unpleasant but are not causing immediate harm:
- Brain activity remains the same

- Having an episode is not caused by and does not cause long-term internal damage.

---
class: top, left
# Common concerns about NEAD

**Risk of injury**
-  NEAD episodes do not cause internal damage
-  Risk of injury from falls during episodes is low
(number of injuries VS total number of episodes)

**Duration of episodes**
-  Episodes can last seconds, minutes, hours or even days.
-  Even if the episode lasts a long time (or longer than usual), it is
still not causing internal damage
-  The episode will pass naturally without need for medical
intervention

**Symptom variation**
-  Many people experience episodes that feel very different to one another
-  It is normal for episodes to change over time

# Case Example 2

.Large[Whilst you are treating your patient, his care worker arrives. She lets you know that his name is Alan, he has a moderate learning disability, and has a NEAD diagnosis.

She tells you that he started to have NEAD episodes 3 years ago when he was living in an inpatient care facility. He was frequently restrained and sedated and did not understand why. His experiences were very distressing and, as a consequence, he now fears healthcare professionals.

# Case Example 2 - "An Unhelpful Experience"

**What could be done differently:**
-  Don’t assume that I am drunk/ a druggie
-  Don’t assume that I am play acting for attention
-  Do treat me with compassion – I am a person who is not in control and feeling very scared
- Don’t tell me to get up, talk, stop burbling, telling me there’s no reason why I can’t talk
-  Understand that the episodes can come in waves and I, like many people, can be thrown back in to another episode one after another for several hours
-  Please offer me a drink with straw and then hold it – I am not able to move and, when episodes last for hours, can get pretty thirsty
-  Do provide reassurance
-  Do sit next to me, don’t stand over me

# Case Example 2 - "A Helpful Experience"

### The most helpful things that the paramedic team did:
-  They were calm
-  They took on board all the information they could find in my bag and the lanyard
-  They worked out that I could sometimes respond by nodding slightly and shaking head very slightly. They were quick to pick that up and the grunts I made! That made a massive difference.
-  When I was in the ambulance the paramedic asked me if I wanted the straps on me kept on. I still couldn’t talk or respond much but she seemed to understand that I could hear and understand. It was so helpful to keep the straps on because of my violent jerking. She was able to understand that I needed them staying.
-  I can’t remember if the paramedic asked me if I could hear her and understand her but I think she must have done.
-  Paramedics explained my diagnosis to staff at the emergency dept.
