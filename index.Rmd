# Definitions: FND

- DSM-5: a patient can be diagnosed with FND if they have motor and/or sensory findings providing “evidence of incompatibility between the symptom and recognized neurological or medical conditions” (American Psychiatric Association, 2013, Stone et al., 2010b).
- The symptom must impair social and/or occupational functioning or lead individuals to seek a medical opinion. There are no duration or severity criteria or explicit rules for exclusion based on additional symptoms.
- In the neurological literature, there are also diagnostic criteria for FND subtypes, such as those for FND-seiz (LaFrance et al., 2013a) and FND-movt (Espay and Lang, 2015, Gasca-Salas and Lang, 2016, Williams et al., 1995).

Above taken from Perez et al 2021

- **Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder** the most recent term used in the ICD-11 (World Health Organization International Coding manual) despite pushback from FND Hope and leading FND specialists around the world.

# Definitions: Non-epileptic seizures

- One manifestation or constellation of FND.
- In DSM-5, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are classified as a form of conversion disorder, or functional neurological symptom disorder, with the term "functional" referring to an impairment of normal bodily functioning (3).
- Disruption of usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, id, or perception (amnesia, fugue, dissociative id disorder, depersonalisation disorder) (Goldstein et al, 2000)

# Inter and Intra-variability

- Different people experience different symptoms (as illustrated in the co-occurance network in a previous slide).
- Symptoms of non-epileptic attacks are not always the same.
- Symptoms change over time
  - For example, some patients with functional seizures may initially experience  panic attacks, but over time, symptoms of anxiety may diminish and manifesta- tions of dissociation increase (Goldstein and Mellers, 2006).

# How common is NEAD?

**Approximately:**

- 20,000 people in the UK have this diagnosis – but there are likely to be many more.
- 1 out of every 5 people referred to a first seizure clinic go on to have a diagnosis of NEAD.
- NEAD accounts for up to 50% of patients brought to hospital with suspected ‘status epilepticus’. Still likely to be an under estimate.

(Howell, Owen, Chadwick, 1989; Kotsoupoulos et al., 2003, Rawlings, Brown & Reuber, 2017)

A recent estimate of prevalence from Norway found prevalence to be 23.8 per 100,000<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/epi.16949"> (Villagrán 2021) </a>

**Note:** It is hard to accurately quantify prevalence rates in non-epileptic attacks due to common diagnostic delay and patients being lost to follow-up.

---
# Who is most likely to be affected?

1. **Age:**
Recent research has shown that young people (15–19) may actually be more at risk <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/epi.16949">Villagrán (2021) </a> - 59.5 per 100,000
1. **Epilepsy**
High rate of comorbidity.
1. **Psychiatric comorbdity**
1. **Trauma**
1. **Gender** Gender disparities are far less evident in younger and older cohorts (e.g.,

# Diagnosis

.pull-left[
### How is it diagnosed?
Diagnosis usually by a Neurologist or Neuropsychiatrist based on:

- Clinical history
- Videos
- Objective signs
- Subjective experience
- EEG (electroencephalogram) 
- ECG (electrocardiogram)
- Videotelemetry
]

.pull-right[Journey to diagnosis can be
.red[very long].
Recent estimate of 3.2 years (although 48% in same year).

# Misdiagnosis & delayed diagnosis

Because NEAD can have clinical comparisons to epilepsy it can be difficult to distinguish one from the other.

This can lead to a variety of concerns around:
- Diagnostic delay.
- Response to status epilepticus.
- Prolonged use of anti-convulsants.
- Lack of access to neccersary support.

New paper demonstrating rates of people diagnosed and treated for status epilepticus who infact had non-epileptic attack <a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/early/2021/08/16/jnnp-2021-326443.full.pdf">(Jungilligens et al., 2021) </a>

???
Among 1210 patients diagnosed and treated as status epilepticus, 980 were aged eight years or older. Of these patients, 79 (8.1%) were discharged with a final diagnosis of pPNES. Of these, 55 (70%) were female and the mean age was 32.6 years (SD: 15.9 years), ranging from eight to 84 years.

# Influence of trauma

-  A traumatic event = an incident that causes physical, emotional or psychological harm.
-  Can be single event or many unpleasant/threatening incidents
-  Could be recent or a long time ago

**FACT:** It is common for people with NEAD to have experienced some form of trauma

**BUT**: Many people with NEAD have NOT experienced a trauma

Although many people with NEAD can identify things that have happened/ are happening in their lives that contribute to a build-up of stress, many people do not.

The reasons why an individual develops NEAD is not always obvious at first, because everyone’s lives are different.

1. Physical stress in the body (e.g., injury, illness, pain).
2. Difficult past experiences (e.g., situations that have felt threatening, loss of a loved one).
3. Current stressful situations (e.g., relating to finances, relationships, difficulty meeting responsibilities, loss of independence).
4. Emotional stress (e.g., worries about the future, difficult memories).

For many people, it is not one big thing that has caused them to go into and stay in the amber zone. It is often a combination of factors.

# Triggers

.small[A study in which 100 patients with PNES (diagnosed by video-EEG) self-reported their experience of PNES manifestations demonstrated considerable heterogeneity of experiences of seizure triggers (measured by using a questionnaire listing 86 possible symptoms, including several questions relating to triggers or warnings). Only a small minority of patients (10%) stated that they were “always” aware of triggers, 57% were aware of triggers for some but not all of their PNES, and 31% claimed never to be aware of triggers. In the same study, 43% of patients stated that their PNES “always” “come on out of the blue without warning,” 51% responded that at least some of their PNES came on in this way and 6% said this never happened. Whilst this study therefore suggested that PNES triggers may (at least at times) be experienced by just over one-half of patients, PNES witnesses questioned in the same study reported being aware of seizure triggers more often than patients them- selves (Reuber et al., 2011)


The most commonly perceived trig- gers were emotional states (50%: feeling stressed, upset, anxious, aroused, neglected, nonspecific unwell). Bodily states (21%: illness, loss of sleep, feeling hot or cold, tiredness, pain, feeling dehydrated or exhausted after something energetic) and external stimuli (9%: crowded
places, flashing lights, black and white patterns, blue light, flashing lights, smoke / flames / dogs / household objects acting as traumatic reminders, sun on surface, neon lights) were less commonly described potential triggers (S. Howlett, personal communication).]

# Warnings

The frequency with which prodromal or warning symptoms of PNES have been self-reported in patient cohorts varies widely, between 24% and 92% (for review see Reuber & Rawlings, )

# Experiences during the seizure

- Tends to last longer than in epilepsy.
- One study found that generalized tonic-clonic seizures lasted 50–92 seconds, whereas PNES lasted 20–805 seconds; Many PNES went on for more than 2 minutes (Gates et al., 1985).
- PNES continuing for over 30 minutes (also called pseudostatus or PNES status) occur in about one-third of patientsm
- More than one-quarter of patients diagnosed with PNES at epilepsy centers have received intensive care treatment for presumed status epilepticus at least once (Reuber et al., 2003).

# Common concerns about NEAD

The changes that are experienced before, during and after episodes are caused by the fight/ flight/ freeze response

These changes might look and feel uncomfortable/ unpleasant but are not causing immediate harm:
- Brain activity remains the same

- Having an episode is not caused by and does not cause internal damage.

# Common concerns about NEAD

**Risk of injury**
-  NEAD episodes do not cause internal damage
-  Risk of injury from falls during episodes is low
(number of injuries VS total number of episodes)

**Duration of episodes**
-  Episodes can last seconds, minutes, hours or even days.
-  Even if the episode lasts a long time (or longer than usual), it is
still not causing internal damage
-  The episode will pass naturally without need for medical
intervention

**Symptom variation**
-  Many people experience episodes that feel very different to one another
-  It is normal for episodes to change over time

# How we talk about NEAD matters

.pull-left[
Communication has a significant impact on:

-  Patient satisfaction
-  Acceptance of the diagnosis
-  Frequency/ severity of symptoms
-  Future engagement with healthcare services

# Case Example 1

.Large[You are called to an incident in a shopping centre. The report is of someone experiencing a sudden collapse. You arrive to find a man, approximately 50 years old, on the floor making jerking movements with his arms and legs. His eyes are closed and he is not responding to your questions.]

.large[*Q: What are the standard assessments and interventions you would carry out in this situation?*
]

class: top, left

# Case Example 2

.Large[Whilst you are treating your patient, his care worker arrives. She lets you know that his name is Alan, he has a moderate learning disability, and has a NEAD diagnosis.

She tells you that he started to have NEAD episodes 3 years ago when he was living in an inpatient care facility. He was frequently restrained and sedated and did not understand why. His experiences were very distressing and, as a consequence, he now fears healthcare professionals.
]

.large[*Taking this information into consideration*:
1. *Q: How might you change your approach?*
2. *Q: What might you do the same?*

# Case Example 2 - "An Unhelpful Experience"

**What could be done differently:**
-  Don’t assume that I am drunk/ a druggie
-  Don’t assume that I am play acting for attention
-  Do treat me with compassion – I am a person who is not in control and feeling very scared
- Don’t tell me to get up, talk, stop burbling, telling me there’s no reason why I can’t talk
-  Understand that the episodes can come in waves and I, like many people, can be thrown back in to another episode one after another for several hours
-  Please offer me a drink with straw and then hold it – I am not able to move and, when episodes last for hours, can get pretty thirsty
-  Do provide reassurance
-  Do sit next to me, don’t stand over me

# Case Example 2 - "A Helpful Experience"

### The most helpful things that the paramedic team did:
-  They were calm
-  They took on board all the information they could find in my bag and the lanyard
-  They worked out that I could sometimes respond by nodding slightly and shaking head very slightly. They were quick to pick that up and the grunts I made! That made a massive difference.
-  When I was in the ambulance the paramedic asked me if I wanted the straps on me kept on. I still couldn’t talk or respond much but she seemed to understand that I could hear and understand. It was so helpful to keep the straps on because of my violent jerking. She was able to understand that I needed them staying.
-  I can’t remember if the paramedic asked me if I could hear her and understand her but I think she must have done.
-  Paramedics explained my diagnosis to staff at the emergency dept.
